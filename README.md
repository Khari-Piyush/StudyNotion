StudyNotion – EdTech Platform
StudyNotion is a fully functional EdTech platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS). It enables users to create, consume, and rate educational content, providing a dynamic and interactive learning experience.

This project was originally developed as part of the CodeHelp Web Development Bootcamp under the guidance of Love Babbar. I am now extending the project by integrating AI/ML models to align it with real-world industry standards and elevate its capabilities.
